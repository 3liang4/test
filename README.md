# Sample SVG Icon usage for Vue.js

A demo to show how I prefer to set up an SVG icon system in Vue.js. You don't have to do it this way, it's an opinionated example. More details for _why_ it's set up in this manner in the Vue Cookbook.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
